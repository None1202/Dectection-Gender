Gender Recognition using MobileNetV2
This repository contains a deep learning-based gender recognition system built using TensorFlow and Keras. The model utilizes the MobileNetV2 architecture for feature extraction, combined with a custom classification layer to predict the gender (Male or Female) based on facial images.

Project Overview
The primary objective of this project is to develop an efficient system that can predict gender from images captured in real-time through a webcam. The system leverages MobileNetV2, a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN), for image feature extraction. The model is further enhanced with a classification head to determine gender based on face images.

Features
Real-time gender prediction: The system uses a webcam to capture video frames and predict gender.

Face detection: Uses OpenCV's Haar Cascade Classifier to detect faces in real-time.

MobileNetV2 architecture: Leverages the pre-trained MobileNetV2 model for feature extraction, which is lightweight and efficient for mobile and edge devices.

Easy integration: The model can be easily integrated into applications that require gender recognition functionality.

Installation
To use this project, you'll need Python 3.x installed, along with TensorFlow, OpenCV, and other dependencies. You can set up the environment with the following steps:

Step 1: Clone the repository
bash
Salin
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Detection-Gender.git
cd Detection-Gender
Step 2: Install dependencies
You can use pip to install the required libraries:

bash
Salin
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Step 3: Download the pre-trained model weights
The model uses MobileNetV2, pre-trained on ImageNet. Ensure that you have an internet connection for downloading the weights during model initialization.

Step 4: Run the application
To start the webcam and begin gender prediction, run the following command:

bash
Salin
Edit
python gender_recognition.py
The webcam feed will open, and the system will predict gender (Male or Female) based on detected faces.

Code Explanation
MobileNetV2: This is a lightweight model used for efficient image classification. The code utilizes this model with the top layer removed to act as a feature extractor.

Face Detection: The code uses OpenCVâ€™s Haar Cascade Classifier to detect faces in real-time. Once a face is detected, the region of interest (ROI) is passed to the model for prediction.

Gender Classification: A dense layer with softmax activation classifies the extracted features into two categories: Male or Female.

Usage
After running the application, the webcam feed will show the real-time video. The predicted gender will be displayed on the frame as text.
