# Gender Detection using MobileNetV2

## Project Overview
This project is an automatic gender detection system using facial recognition technology. The system utilizes MobileNetV2, a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, to classify faces as either Male or Female based on the facial features. The system also integrates OpenCV for face detection from images or video feeds.

## Key Features
- **Real-time Gender Prediction**: Automatically detects gender (Male/Female) using a webcam feed.
- **Face Detection**: Uses OpenCV's Haar Cascade Classifier to detect faces in real-time.
- **MobileNetV2**: A pre-trained lightweight CNN model is used for accurate gender classification.
- **Easy to Use**: Simple interface for capturing face images through the webcam and displaying the gender prediction.
- **High Accuracy**: Achieves high accuracy in gender classification based on facial features.

## Technology Stack
- **Deep Learning**: MobileNetV2 for gender classification.
- **Face Detection**: OpenCV for detecting faces from video feeds.
- **Webcam Integration**: OpenCV for capturing video from the webcam and processing frames.
- **Python Libraries**: TensorFlow, OpenCV, Numpy, and others for model training and inference.
